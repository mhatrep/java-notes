# Stream pipeline. 

The stream pipeline made of the following three parts:

1 Stream builder — Collection, arrays (Arrays.stream()) and generator functions (Stream.iterate() and Stream.generate()).

2 Intermediate operation(s) — Apply zero, one or more than one operations on the stream by chaining the operations, like in a builder pattern. 

3 Terminal operation — Finish the pipeline by applying a mandatory terminal operator.
